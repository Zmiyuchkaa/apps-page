      <p>WhatsApp Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for Android and other smartphones. 
        WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) 
        to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, 
        calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.

      <h5>WHY USE WHATSAPP:</h5>
      <p>
          • NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) 
          to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* 
          There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.
          • MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.
          • FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.
          * WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. 
          (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other 
          emergency service numbers through WhatsApp).
      </p>

      <p>
        • GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.
        • WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.
        • NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. 
        Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.*
        • SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? 
        WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book.
      </p>

      <p>
          • ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. 
          No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out.
          • QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily 
          connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.
          • OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your 
          recent messages until the next time you use the app.
          • AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, 
          email chat history, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!
